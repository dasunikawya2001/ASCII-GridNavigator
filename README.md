# ASCII-GridNavigator
ASCII-GridNavigator is a C-based program that calculates the shortest path on a grid-based map.
The program calculates the minimum distance path from a starting point to an ending point on a 2D map, following specific movement constraints based on ASCII values. This project demonstrates using fundamental programming concepts like arrays, functions, linked lists, and global variables in C, along with creative problem-solving.

## Milestones
**Milestone 1**
- Parse a map string into a 2D array.
- Calculate the shortest path between two points with movement constraints.

**Milestone 2**
- Identify teleportation doors using Fibonacci calculations.
- Incorporate teleportation into the shortest path calculation.

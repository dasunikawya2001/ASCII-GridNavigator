# ASCII-GridNavigator
ASCII-GridNavigator is a C-based program that calculates the shortest path on a grid-based map.
The program calculates the minimum distance path from a starting point to an ending point on a 2D map, following specific movement constraints based on ASCII values. This project demonstrates using fundamental programming concepts like arrays, functions, linked lists, and global variables in C, along with creative problem-solving.

Features:
  Dynamic Map Creation
  Pathfinding Algorithm
  Custom Movement Rules

Example Use Case:
  Input:
    5 5  
    0 0  
    4 2  
    ABCCDGLCKEZZBLFXYCMGDVEGH 
  Output:
    The minimum distance from A to E is 6
